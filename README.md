AWS exam notes for AI &amp; data specialty tracks

Long-term, I'd like to do the full AI exam path and the full database exam path. 

After that, between studying for exams, I'd like to take my career in the direction of expertise in prompt engineering, LLMs, and making meaning from unstructured data.
